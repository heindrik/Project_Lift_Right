## Description
The following project is a Windows Application for Kinect 2.0. This application tracks Bicep curls and Dumbell Raises and ensure that proper form is met during the exercise. Example: While doing a bicep curl, if your elbow is not close to your waist, the application will let the user know via the GUI.
